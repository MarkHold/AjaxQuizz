# AjaxQuizz
A javascript quiz application that uses AJAX requests, JSON and does not use any JQuery libraries.
 
The goal is to create a client application in which the user can answer, 
by the server given, quiz-questions. The user must do this in a certain time. If the user gives the correct answer,
the application will take the user to the next question. If the user give the wrong answer or didn´t in time the quiz is over.

At the start of the game the user should be able to write a nickname she/he wants in the quiz game. The game must have a timer that gives the user a maximum of 20 seconds to answer each question. 
If the user doesn´t answer during the time or the user answer wrong it is game over and the user should be able to start the game over.
If the user answer all of the questions with correct answers the game should record the users total time and present this in a high-score list with the five fastest times.
The high-score will be saved in the browsers Web Storage.
